# Software DAC (two output version) library for Attiny 25 / 45 / 85
## by SkyWodd

This library is designed to create two software DAC with two fast PWM output.
A low-pass RC filter is needed on the PMW pinw to smooth the PWM signal into a pseudo analog signal.

Ps: This version of the library can handle two softDAC output.
A single output version is also available on my github.

PPs: A python script tool is also include to convert image into XY data files (used by the example).
